
Headers:
* _headername.h headers are private, and will not be distributed. Don't include these files from public headers.
* Keep _ifdef's in public headers to an absolute minimum.
* Public headers should contain only classes that are exported (class CLUCENE_EXPORT classname).
* All classes should have a destructor, 
  the destructor should be virtual if there is any chance of the class being overridden
